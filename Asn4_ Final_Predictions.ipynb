Any columns that were either categorical and did not have any information that was relevant, such as address information, or numerical but not important to the situation, like the credit card number, were removed. Columns that were categorical and would not have too many categories for one hot encoding were left in, while the numerical data was scaled.\n","\n","##### The model design involved six layers, one normalization layer, one dense and one dropout layer, then two dense layers with L1 and L2 regularization to reduce overfitting, and finally one dense output layer.
